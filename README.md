ARTG139 Final: Queer-iousity

Welcome to "Queer-iousity" where you play as Alex, a rich queer guru, navigating through his love life and have to keep up the facade of being "normal".
In addition, you are trying to figure out if Vernon ,your blind date, is here for money or love. The purpose of this game is to combat stereotypes 
regarding queer folks finding love in the modern world. During my ideation process, this idea of queer love and queer stereotypes was one of the things
that came to mind and I ended up deciding to base my project on it. By the end of the process, my project went from a physical game where I had a deck
of cards and whoever had the joker would be the MC and red cards would be love and black would be money but decided to do an
online narrative in the end instead.
