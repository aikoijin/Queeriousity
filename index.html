				<p>Welcome to "Queer-iousity" where you play as Alex, a rich queer guru, navigating through his love life
					and have to keep up the facade of being "normal". In addition, you are trying to figure out if Vernon ,your blind date, is
					here for money or love.
					<br><br>
					The purpose of this game is to combat stereotypes regarding queer folks finding love in the modern world.
					During my ideation process, this idea of queer love and queer stereotypes was one of the things that came to mind and I 
					ended up deciding to base my project on it. By the end of the process, my project went from a physical game where I had a deck
					of cards and whoever had the joker would be the MC and red cards would be love and black would be money but decided to do an
					online narrative in the end instead.
